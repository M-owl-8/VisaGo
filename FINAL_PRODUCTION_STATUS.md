## 🔧 What You Must Do (Terminal Commands Only)

### Step 1: Database Migration (REQUIRED)

**On your local machine (for testing):**

```bash
cd apps/backend
npm install  # if needed
npm run db:migrate:dev
npm run db:generate
```

**On production server:**

```bash
cd apps/backend
npm install  # if needed
npm run db:migrate:deploy
npm run db:generate
```

**See:** `DB_MIGRATION_INSTRUCTIONS.md` for detailed instructions

### Step 2: Environment Variables

**Backend (`apps/backend/.env.production`):**

```env
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3000
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/db
JWT_SECRET=<generate-with-openssl-rand-base64-32>
CORS_ORIGIN=https://yourdomain.uz
FRONTEND_URL=https://yourdomain.uz
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

**Web App (`apps/web/.env.production`):**

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.yourdomain.uz
NEXT_PUBLIC_AI_SERVICE_URL=https://ai.yourdomain.uz
```

**See:** `ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md` for complete list

### Step 3: Build & Deploy

**On production server:**

```bash
# Build web app
cd apps/web
npm install
npm run build

# Build backend
cd ../backend
npm install
npm run build

# Start services (with PM2)
pm2 start npm --name "visabuddy-backend" -- run start:prod
pm2 start npm --name "visabuddy-web" -- start
pm2 save
```

**See:** `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE_UZ_SERVER.md` for complete deployment steps

## ✅ Verification Checklist

After deployment, verify:

- [ ] Database migration completed successfully
- [ ] Backend starts without errors (`pm2 logs visabuddy-backend`)
- [ ] Web app starts without errors (`pm2 logs visabuddy-web`)
- [ ] Health check works: `curl https://api.yourdomain.uz/api/health`
- [ ] Web app loads: `curl https://yourdomain.uz`
- [ ] Can register new account
- [ ] Can login with email/password
- [ ] Can complete questionnaire
- [ ] Checklist is generated (check database)
- [ ] Checklist is retrieved on subsequent page loads (not regenerated)

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Phone Authentication

**Phone number authentication (OTP/SMS) is NOT implemented.**

- Current auth methods: Email/password, Google OAuth
- This is intentional - no broken phone auth flows exist
- Can be added in future if needed

### Database Migration

**The migration MUST be run before the app will work correctly.**

- Without it, checklist generation will fail
- See `DB_MIGRATION_INSTRUCTIONS.md` for exact commands

### Environment Variables

**All required environment variables must be set.**

- Backend will fail to start if `DATABASE_URL` or `JWT_SECRET` are missing
- See `ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md` for complete list

## 🖥️ VPS Deployment Ready

### Deployment Artifacts Added

Complete VPS deployment package has been added to `deployment/vps/`:

- ✅ PM2 ecosystem configuration for process management
- ✅ Nginx reverse proxy configuration with SSL/TLS
- ✅ Production environment variables template (Railway Postgres compatible)
- ✅ Step-by-step deployment checklist
- ✅ PostgreSQL database setup hints (optional - for local DB)
- ✅ Complete architecture documentation

### Recommended Setup: Railway Backend + Railway Postgres + VPS Web

**Architecture:**

- **Database:** Railway Postgres (remote) - already working
- **Backend:** Railway (already working with mobile app) - optional to move to VPS
- **Web:** VPS (what we're deploying)

**Benefits:**

- ✅ Consistent backend for mobile and web apps
- ✅ No database migration needed
- ✅ Simpler VPS setup (only web app)
- ✅ Can optionally move backend to VPS later

### Quick Deploy Commands

After setting up the VPS and environment variables:

```bash
npm install
# Use Railway Postgres DATABASE_URL from Railway dashboard
npm run db:migrate:deploy  # Runs against Railway Postgres
npm run db:generate
npm run build:web  # Only build web if backend stays on Railway
# OR: npm run build:all  # If deploying backend too
pm2 start deployment/vps/pm2.ecosystem.config.cjs
pm2 save
```

**Important Configuration:**

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`: Set to your Railway backend URL (same as mobile app uses)
- `DATABASE_URL`: Use Railway Postgres connection string (from Railway dashboard)
- `CORS_ORIGIN`: Add VPS domain (`https://ketdik.uz`) to Railway backend CORS settings

See `deployment/vps/deploy_checklist.md` for detailed instructions.
