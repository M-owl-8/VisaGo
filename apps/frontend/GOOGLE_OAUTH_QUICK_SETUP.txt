⏳ ACTION ITEMS (Manual Setup Required)
---------------------------------------

STEP 1: Google Cloud Console Setup (15 mins)
[   ] Go to https://console.cloud.google.com
[   ] Create new project: "VisaBuddy"
[   ] Enable APIs:
      - Google+ API
      - Identity Toolkit API
      - Google Identity Services API
[   ] Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials:
      ✓ Web application client
      ✓ Android client
      ✓ iOS client

STEP 2: Get Web Client ID (5 mins)
[   ] In Google Cloud Console Credentials page:
[   ] Copy Web Client ID
[   ] Format: 123456789-abcdefghij.apps.googleusercontent.com

STEP 3: Get Android SHA-1 Fingerprint (5 mins)
[   ] cd apps/frontend/android
[   ] Run: ./gradlew signingReport (Windows: gradlew.bat)
[   ] Copy SHA-1 fingerprint
[   ] Format: AB:CD:EF:12:34:56:78:9A:BC:DE:F0:12:34:56:78:9A:BC:DE:F0:12
[   ] Add to Android OAuth credentials in Google Cloud Console

STEP 4: Environment Configuration (5 mins)
[   ] Create apps/frontend/.env file
[   ] Add: GOOGLE_WEB_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_WEB_CLIENT_ID_HERE
[   ] Replace with actual Web Client ID from STEP 2

STEP 5: Install Dependencies (10 mins)
[   ] cd apps/frontend
[   ] npm install
[   ] npx pod-install ios (if on Mac)

STEP 6: Test Configuration (5 mins)
[   ] npm run typecheck (should have ZERO errors)
[   ] npm run lint (check for issues)

STEP 7: Test Email/Password Login First (10 mins)
[   ] Start backend: cd apps/backend && npm start
[   ] Start mobile: cd apps/frontend && npm run android
[   ] Test email/password login (verify backend works)
[   ] Stop and proceed to Google OAuth testing

STEP 8: Test Google OAuth on Android (15 mins)
[   ] Clear app data: adb shell pm clear com.visabuddy.app
[   ] npm run android
[   ] Tap Google button on login screen
[   ] Select your Google account
[   ] Approve permissions
[   ] Verify logged in and see user profile

STEP 9: Verify Database (5 mins)
[   ] In backend: npm run db:studio
[   ] Go to User table
[   ] Verify new user created with googleId field populated

STEP 10: Test Google OAuth on iOS (15 mins) [if on Mac]
[   ] npm run ios
[   ] Repeat STEP 8 tests on iOS
[   ] Verify Google OAuth works on iOS

IMPORTANT NOTES
---------------

1. Use Different Client IDs:
   - Web Client ID: for frontend OAuth flow
   - Android Client ID: auto-configured, just needs SHA-1
   - iOS Client ID: auto-configured, just needs Bundle ID

2. Security:
   - NEVER commit .env file to git
   - Add .env to .gitignore
   - Use different credentials for prod vs dev

3. Common Issues:
   - "Play Services not available": Use real device instead of emulator
   - "Invalid Web Client ID": Check .env file has correct ID
   - "SHA-1 mismatch": Regenerate fingerprint and update OAuth credentials

4. Testing Sequence:
   [1] Email/Password login (basic auth)
   [2] Google OAuth on Android
   [3] Google OAuth on iOS
   [4] Database verification
   [5] Error handling (try wrong password, etc)
