## ✅ Step 1: OpenAI API Setup (30 minutes)

### Action Items:

1. **Go to:** https://platform.openai.com
2. **Create account** (if you don't have one)
3. **Add payment method** (required for API access)
4. **Generate API key:**
   - Go to: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
   - Click "Create new secret key"
   - Name it: "VisaBuddy Production"
   - **Copy the key immediately** (you won't see it again!)
   - Format: `sk-...` (starts with "sk-")

5. **Set usage limits:**
   - Go to: https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/limits
   - Set monthly budget: $50-100 (recommended)
   - This prevents unexpected charges

### ✅ Once you have the API key, tell me and I'll help you add it to the .env files!
